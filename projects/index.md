# Projects

I am currently working on [Vagabond](https://www.vagabondgame.com/), a 2D RPG with living procedurally generated open worlds. The game is currently in alpha on [itch.io](https://pvigier.itch.io/vagabond-demo) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1673090/Vagabond/). You can find all my devlogs [here](/tag/vagabond). You can find more screenshots and updates on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/PierreVigier).

You can find my scripts and libraries on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/pvigier/).

The games I developed:

* [Jumpy Fox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PierreVigier.JumpyFox): a small game on Android.
* [Simulopolis](https://pvigier.itch.io/simulopolis): a sandbox city building game with pcg and ai.

The tools I developed:

* [gitamine](https://github.com/pvigier/gitamine): a graphical user interface for git.
