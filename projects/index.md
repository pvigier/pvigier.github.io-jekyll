# Projects

I am currently working on Vagabond, a roguelite 2D RPG. You can find all my devlogs [here](/tag/vagabond). You can find more screenshots and updates on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/PierreVigier).

The libraries I maintain:

* [MyGAL](https://github.com/pvigier/MyGAL) ([documentation](/docs/mygal/)): a computational geometry algorithms library.
* [noisette](https://github.com/pvigier/noisette): a noise-generating library.
* [ecs](https://github.com/pvigier/ecs): an entity-component-system library.

The games I developed:

* [Jumpy Fox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PierreVigier.JumpyFox): a small game on Android.
* [Simulopolis](https://pvigier.itch.io/simulopolis): a sandbox city building game with pcg and ai.

The tools I developed:

* [gitamine](https://github.com/pvigier/gitamine): a graphical user interface for git.
