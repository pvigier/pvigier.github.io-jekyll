Welcome on my new website!

I will try to keep it up-to-date. And to write a post as soon as I have an idea or discovered anything interesting. Stay Tuned!

A short word on the technologies which proudly power this website. As you can see, the website is gracefully hosted by GitHub. Thanks guys! This website is completely static, I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate the pages. By the way, I found this [page](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) very interesting to get started with Jekyll. And the design is made with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

I try [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) as commenting system. I've seen a lot of blogs using it and it was very easy to install. Finally, I use [Google Webmasters](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) and [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) to manage my metrics.

I hope you'll find anything interesting here!
